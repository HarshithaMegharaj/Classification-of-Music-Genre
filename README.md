# Classification-of-Music-Genre
This project proposes a framework for music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset. Advanced signal processing techniques extract features like MFCCs and chroma features, while ensemble machine learning models achieve high accuracy. The findings support applications in music recommendation systems, music therapy, and computational musicology.
